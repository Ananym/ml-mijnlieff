# Game and Model Design Decisions

## Game Representation

- Board State: 4x4x3 grid
  - 3 channels: Player 1 pieces, Player 2 pieces, Empty spaces
- Available Moves: 4x4x4 grid
  - 4 channels: Permitted play area for each piece type (Diag, Ortho, Near, Far)

## Model Architecture

- Value Network
  - Estimates probability of winning from any given state

## Training Approach

- Self-play adversarial training
- Full games from the start (no curriculum learning)
- Reinforcement Learning algorithm: To be determined (no specific preference)

## Reward Structure

- Win: +1
- Loss: -1
- Draw: 0
- Rewards given at the end of the game

## Special Cases

- Implement a simple heuristic for "passing turn" scenario

## Training Details

- Number of training games/episodes: To be determined during experimentation
- Training environment: Reasonably capable desktop PC

## Evaluation

- Performance evaluation to be handled separately (not part of this implementation)

## Not Implemented

- Separate opponent model
- Point system in rewards
- Curriculum learning

- independently tested mcts vs strategic to fix logic issues
- took about 12000 mcts sims to hit 75% winrate!

- scale down strategic, scale up self play to avoid being overfit to the strategic opp

- we had semi-good performance through just self play + strategic, but not good enough

- runtime woes! never figured this out

- hard to spot subtle bugs in mcts logic

- mcts bulk of the train time, model size kinda irrelevent
